# Module 1 - Installation blog post 1



Some creative decisions that lead me to work on my project was the basis of finding a home. 
I decided to quote James Baldwin because he is my one of my idols and has been a big influence on my life. I decided on the generative art being
spontaneous and encompass taking up space. After the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United state. This country did not see a use for 
African American anymore, and did not want to make space for them in society pushing them into ghettos and this would create further generational traumas 
and make it even more challenging to break cycles of poverty. So the eclipse taking over the screen was meant to symbolize that African Americans are here 
and deserve as much dignity, opportunities and rights as their fellow white Americans. What the poem means to me is that home is a condition and not a 
place. It can be found anywhere on this planet and it is in an internal state of loving oneâ€™s brother and no one is able to take this away from you. 

Some technical issues I encountered in creating my work was the timing of the words and the art being displayed so that you can be able to see both of 
them. I was thinking to make the words disappear while the eclipes were on the screen but I liked the sort of chaotic and disruptive way of the eclipse 
being on top of the words so that is why I decided to only time the eclipses. Another technical issue that I can come across was making sure to have the 
right settings. This took me awhile to figure out because of other technical issues with my machine so make sure to follow the instructions after any 
software updates.
