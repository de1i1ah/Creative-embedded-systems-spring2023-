## Module 1 - Millie Installation blog post 1



Some creative decisions that lead me to work on my project was the basis of finding a home . 
I decided to quote james baldwin because he is my one of my idols and has been a big influence on my life So that is why
I choose the poem I did. I decided on the generative art that would be spontaneous and encompass taking up space. 
Because just the history of slavery and african americans in the United state has not been considered fully human or
even given the same dignity as their fellow man. I choose the eclipse because it encampasses taking up space which is 
something that has lead to the loss of lives. 

Here is a link to a video of the installation:
