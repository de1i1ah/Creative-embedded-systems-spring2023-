# Final Project - Hopscotch Installation blog post

For our Final project, we created a finger-sized hopscotch that lights up as you hop on each tile. 
	
We wanted to create an animated display of technology reminiscent of our childhoods. Growing up, hopscotch was one of my favorite games, so I was excited to make this project come to life. Some decisions we had to make were how to power the LED lights in our enclosure, display the button effectively and seamlessly, and organize the internal hardware. We decided not to use batteries and power the LED lights using the energy from a laptop. The buttons were tricky because they were so small and connected to the breadboard by wires, so they had no foundation to rest on. We decided to use the circles that were laser cut off and super glue them on top of the buttons to conceal the actual buttonsâ€”then created another wooded plank on the bottom of the buttons so that they had support and you could press them. Finally, we used tape to secure the wooden planet underneath the buttons. We also had to use solder to connect the buttons to the wires, and this was tricky because the solder would sometimes break. Also, there is a particular way you have to connect the wires to the pins of the buttons for them to work. So we found out that they must be diagonal from each other.   \

As you can see in the photo, there was a lot of "loose" hardware inside our enclosure. To fix this, we used tape to organize the wires and securely ensure there wasn't cross-contamination.

From a sheet of plywood, we laser-cut our front plate and used a saw for the rest of the pieces of our wooden box. Next, we laser cut holes for the buttons, LED Lights, and a little port for a USB-c wire.

Some other design challenges one might face replicating our design would be building a wooden box from scratch. This was much more difficult than one would think. For this process, I used a saw and an orbital sanding machine to make all the pieces of wood symmetrical and precisely the same. After I got the pieces to fit, I had to use wood glue to assemble parts of the box securely. I used the clamps and let the glue dry overnight. We decided to make the box open from the bottom because it made the most sense with our specialized hardware. I had to use hinges to secure the bottom plate; unfortunately, they were a bit too small, so the tip for everyone is to ensure your hinges are the appropriate size. To fix this, I had to be careful not to scrape the nails in the box and screwed them on with a drill as best as possible.

In the photo we can see a bird's eye view of our enclosure which looks much more organized and pretty verus the inside.
